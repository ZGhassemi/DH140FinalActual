While I tried to me encompassing with my dataset, I do realize it is small and therefore limited. While there's a wealth of information on literature published in previous centuries on Wikipedia, I was reliant on what was available on Project Gutenberg, which did not have everything. I hope to continue to develop this project possibly for my Digital Humanities capstone.
